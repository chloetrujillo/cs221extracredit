The course is oriented toward the user of financial accounting data (rather than the preparer) and emphasizes the reconstruction and interpretation of economic events from published accounting reports.\nThis course examines the use and preparation of cost and management data for planning, decision-making and control. Emphasis is placed on the actual use of this information to manage the various business processes as well as recent developments in the field. Illustrations are drawn from around the globe to show how these information and management processes are being used. Topics covered include: cost allocation systems, cost for short-term and long-term decision making, customer profitability analysis, balanced scorecards, planning, and management control systems. The course combines cases and shorter exercises and problems.\nA characteristic of business is the extensive use of accounting data.nnThe financial accounting course has the general objective of developingnnstudents' understanding of the nature, scope, and limitations of accounting information. To achieve this objective the course attempts to: (1) developnnstudents' understanding of the conceptual accounting framework, including the objectives of financial reporting, and (2) develop students' ability to understand and critically evaluate the financial disclosures made by corporations. An issue of particular interest will be the managerial incentive aspects of accounting information  and disclosures.\nThe practice of financial management in non-profit organizations is significantly different from that in for-profit businesses. Many of the differences stem from the difficulty of measuring and valuing outputs and from restrictions imposed by donors and grant-making agencies. This course considers accounting, budgeting, financing, investment, and other financial management activities in non-profit organizations, including fund accounting, form and interpretation of financial statements, endowment issues, Internal Revenue Service and state regulation, measurement and evaluation of organizational performance, and control system design. The course is ideally suited for students who expect to manage a nonprofit organization or to serve on a nonprofit board.\nThis course is intended to enhance the student's ability to reconstruct economic events from financial statement disclosures and to aid in developing a coordinated set of concepts and principles to serve as a framework for analyzing a wide variety of global financial reporting issues. The content and instruction are intended to provide a level of understanding and competence appropriate for global general managers in choosing among alternative financial accounting measurement procedures and establishing corporate financial reporting policies, and for those interested in understanding global financial accounting and reporting at a level more sophisticated than that in A210. The course is recommended for anyone planning a career that will involve issuing or analyzing financial statements of for-profit entities, such as careers in corporate top management, banking, or investment analysis.\nThis course aims to develop students' understanding of the relation between accounting numbers and underlying economic activity, and to develop students' ability to use accounting numbers in several decision contexts including financial reporting strategy and valuation. Accordingly, the course will focus on several factors essential to this goal. These include understanding (1) the process that generates accounting numbers and its implications for the quality of those numbers for decision purposes, (2) the business environment a firm operates in and the firm's financial, accounting and operating strategies, (3) tools for assessing a firm's performance including ratio and cash flow analysis and forecasting techniques, and (4) valuation models based on discounted cash flows and on accounting earnings numbers or book values. This course should be of value to students who expect to be in senior positions within corporations and will determine financial reporting policies, as well as those outside corporations who will make decisions at least partly based on financial statement information.\nNeed approval from sponsoring faculty member and GSB Registrar.\nThis seminar will introduce students to research that examines the characteristics of securities analysts' forecasts and recommendations.  This course is ideally suited for students who are interested in doing securities research, investment management, consulting or management of investor relations issues.  Issues examined in the seminar include:nn1.  What are the characteristics of analysts earnings forecasts?  Are they unbiased?  What factors influence their informativeness?  Can analysts' forecasts be improved upon? How are analysts' forecasts affected by investment banking relationships? nn2.  What are the characteristics of analysts' investment recommendations?  Can they be used to earn abnormal returns?  Are analysts' recommendations influenced by investment banking relationships?  Do analysts upgrade and downgrade on a timely basis?nn3.  What factors influence which stocks analysts cover?  How is this affected by a firm's disclosure policy?  Are all stocks covered equally?nn4.  What are the valuation implications of analyst coverage?  Are less closely followed firms discounted?  nn5.  Are there superior analysts who consistently generate higher returns for their clients?  Are these analysts better forecasters?  How persistent is superior performance?  nnnBy introducing students to research that examines the above questions, students will be better prepared to use analysts' research for investment decisions, to produce equity research for use by others, and to manage relations with analysts covering your company or a client company.\nThis course focuses on the design of performance measurement systems including financial as well as non-financial measures. Students will learn what makes a good measurement system. As an application of the ideas developed, we will go over the concept of the Balanced Scorecard. The second objective of the course is to provide the tools and concepts required to design and analyze management systems. After this course, students will be able to design systems--strategic planning systems, performance evaluation systems, risk management systems, ...--that are the backbone of any organization. During the course we will discuss different way to analyze the management systems of an organization. nnnThe course is intended for people that expect to be running an organization (whether for profit or non-for-profit) or involved in its management. The course will provide the tools and concepts to better understand how the systems that govern the interactions within the organization are designed.nnnThe expectations for the course are class attendance and a written project to be handed in on the last day of class.\nManagement control systems are &quot;formal, information-based routines and procedures managers use to maintain or alter patters in organizational activities&quot; (Simons, 1995).  Traditional examples include budgeting systems, strategic planning systems, and resource allocation systems.  They play an important role as mechanisms to generate and implement strategy.  They are also relevant in the day-to-day management to structure operational processes.  Management control systems can be classified in two large blocks of systems: performance measurement and planning systems.  Performance measurement is used to inform managers about the progress of their strategies and operations, evaluate performance, and motivate action.  Planning systems are used to coordinate, motivate, and design the strategy of the firm going forward.  A rich research tradition using different conceptual frameworks exists in both of these areas. nnThe objective of the seminar is to give participants an up-to-date perspective on the current state-of-the-art knowledge on management control systems.  To achieve this objective, I intend to combine classical readings that provide the various perspectives that have been used to study the phenomenon, together with more recent material.  The readings will combine research papers and sections of books, practitioners' articles, and cases.  The content of the seminar will combine a solid background on the knowledge area together with issues that are still open and for which I have a certain interest-either because they are part of my research agenda or because I closely follow their development.  Some examples of the topics that I intend to include are: budgeting, strategic planning as classical areas and management control systems in growing firms and planning systems for new product portfolio design as areas in development.\nThe purpose of this three-quarter seminar is to facilitate the student's conception and execution of substantive individual research.

Specific topics include supply and demand analysis, consumer behavior, theory of cost and production, pricing and competition, factor pricing, and the concepts of marginal analysis. The second portion covers the macro, or aggregative, aspects of the economy. Specific topics include national income accounts; the determination of the level of aggregate output, employment, and prices; the monetary system, including the effects of monetary policy; fiscal policy; economic growth; and international monetary economics\nThis course gives students the background they need to understand the broad movements in the global economy. Key topics include long-run economic growth, technological change, wage inequality, international trade, interest rates, inflation, exchange rates, and monetary policy. By the end of the course, students should be able to read and understand the discussions of economic issues in The Economist. First year students will find that this course helps prepare them for the global business course offered in Spring. All students will find that it offers critical background for other electives such as E305, Europe in the World Economy and P382, International Political Economy.\nThis course will examine the evolution and current status of the European Union as it pursues its agenda of economic convergence, political unification, and expansion to the east. The background is all of Europe as well as the world economy. While the emphasis will be on structure and performance, the major perspective will be that of political economy. France, Germany, and the United Kingdom will be taken as major case studies. The EU's problems and challenges, and economic prospects to 2020, will be analyzed. The course will consist of reading, lectures and discussion, and two papers.\nThe purpose of this course is to use microeconomics to evaluate public policy.  The course has two parts.  The goal of the first part of the course is to provide a comprehensive microeconomic toolkit.  We will use this toolkit (1) to identify what the role of the government in the economy should be, if the only motivation for public intervention in private markets were to improve economic efficiency - that is, to increase the overall size of the economic pie without regard to its distribution and (2) to measure the economic benefits and costs of public policies, and how these benefits and costs are distributed among different actors.  The second part of the course applies this toolkit to current policy issues.  On the first day of class, the students choose from a menu which policy issues we will cover.  The goal of this part of the class is to assess the efficiency and distributional consequences of these policies and to discuss the potential for better alternatives.nnSpr (Kessler)\nThe purpose of this class is to provide students with the economic tools, and the institutional and legal background, to understand how markets for health care products and services work.The class has four parts, consisting of a combination of case studies, lectures, and visits from individuals from the industry:1.  the economic tools:  understanding moral hazard and adverse selection2.  the institutional organization of the health care sector in the US-hospital and physician services markets-integrated delivery systems-managed care-pharmaceutical and medical device industries3.  public policy issues in health care-medical ethics-regulation of managed care, the 'patients bill of rights'-regulation of pharmaceuticals-reform of Medicare-universal health insurance and coverage of the uninsured4.  international perspective-how have other countries' health care systems evolved and what can the US learn from their experiences\nHow do you do cost-benefit analysis when the output is difficult or impossible to measure? How do M.B.A. analytic tools apply in health services? Study/discussion of the main literature on the principles of cost-benefit analysis applied to health care. Critical review of actual studies. Emphasis is on the art of practical application.nnAut (Garber, Sanders, Owens)\nThis course is designed to enhance the student's ability to understand corporate governance systems worldwide. Corporate governance is a subject of great interest to academics, business leaders, investors, and politicians throughout the world. Corporate governance issues arise in institutions if there is a potential conflict of  interest among the stakeholders and the resulting transaction costs cannot be eliminated. Various economies have evolved different mechanisms to resolve the corporate governance issues. Anglo-Saxon systems differ from European and Japanese systems, and Eastern Europe and China, for instance, experiment with the way private organizations should be governed. nnDespite the great interest and intense debate, there is still little empirical evidence on the effectiveness of various governance systems. This course examines most current contributions from various perspectives and from an international angle. The topics to be covered are relevant for firms operating in highly dynamic competitive environments while being confronted with different governance systems. Key topics include principles of corporate governance, the pattern of ownership and control of corporations across countries, corporate governance in transnational companies, the role of institutional investors in company control, the effects of increasing importance of human capital in corporate governance, and challenges of increasing management accountability. The course is recommended for anyone considering a career in international organizations.\nOn November 9, 1989, the people of Berlin tore down the wall dividing their city.  Communism then collapsed, setting in train the biggest economic changes in a short period of time ever to have occurred in history.  Ten years earlier, albeit in less dramatic circumstances, China had initiated similar changes.nnnLooking back on the transition of these countries, we see some spectacular successes and some catastrophic failures (successes such as the transformation of rural China, where hundreds of millions were lifted out of gnawing poverty; failures such as the stagnation of Russia and other former Soviet countries).  In this course we will view the transition from planning to markets as a gigantic natural experiment in economics.  We will ask: what can we learn from it about what takes to build effective markets and firms?\nProfessors Lars Ljungqvist of Stockholm School of Economics and Thomas J. Sargent of Stanford will offernna five week course on contemporary policy problems in macroconomics. The course in macroeconomicsnn(MGTECON 300) is recommended but is not an absolute prerequisite. We will build on ideas from micro-economicsnnand asset pricing.nn1. Welfare states and European unemployment. For the last 20 years, many European countries have hadnnmuch higher unemployment rates and longer average durations of unemployment than the U.S. Theynnalso have much more generous systems for unemployment compensation and other safety nets. Citingnnkey labor market facts from Europe and the U.S., we will study the effect of generous safety nets onnnunemployment and other measures of labor market exibility such as employment protection. We willnnconfront the puzzling fact that the welfare states of Europe were already in place in the 1950s, the 1960snnand the early 1970s when these countries had much lower unemployment rates than the U.S.nn2. A ticking time bomb: social security and proposals for reforming it. The U.S. and many Europeannncountries finance social security and medical care payments on a pay-as-you-go basis. We will evaluatennthe justification for a pay-as-you-go system and compare it with the type of fully funding system tonnwhich President Bush and his advisors want to move. Who gains and who loses from abandoning thenncurrent pay-as-you-go system? What would be the likely effects of a reform on aggregate U.S. economicnnperformance? We'll look at social security problems in several other countries and also at some reformsnnin countries that are ahead of the U.S., at least from President Bush's point of view.nn3. Unpleasant arithmetic: monetary and fiscal causes of in ation and debt crises. Owners of its bondsnnand its national currency are among a government's leading creditors. Governments sometimes borrownntoo much and expose these creditors to losses - defaults for government bonds and in ation for moneynnholders. The 'unpleasant arithmetic' of the government's budget constraint dictates much about feasiblennand wise government policies. We will study classic principles for coordinating monetary and fiscalnnpolicies and will include several dramatic historical episodes such as the spectacular in ations in Europennafter the two World Wars. These historical examples will shed light on monetary and fiscal dilemmasnnfacing the governments of Turkey, Argentina and many other developing countries today.nn4. Credibility. The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets every six or so weeks. Legally,nnthe FOMC (and other government decision making bodies such as ones at the IMF) cannot commitnntheir successors to follow ex ante desirable policies. In designing tax and in ation policies, the timingnnof decisions offers governments temptations to engage in opportunistic behavior with short-run benefitsnnbut also long-run costs. After giving several important examples of such 'time consistency' problemsnnfor public policy, we shall study whether 'reputation' might subtitute for a commitment technology. Wennwill give examples where reputation helps and others (like Argentina today) where it hurts.\nThis course is designed to enhance the students ability to understand the fundamental move toward a world in which national economies are merging into an interdependent global economic system. While the emerging global economy creates opportunities such as this for new entrepreneurs and established businesses around the world, it also gives rise to challenges and threats that business managers did not have to deal with in the past. For example, managers now routinely have to decide which business strategies are to be adopted to reflect national differences in culture, language, business practices, and government regulations. And managers have to decide how best to deal with threats posed by efficient foreign competitors entering their home marketplace. nnThe course combines in a substantial way theoretical and empirical aspects. The theory is based on the combination of two complexes: the theory of foreign trade and the theory of the firm. The theory of foreign trade explains why exchange and trade of input factors and products between national markets occur. The theory of the firm explains why many economic transactions are not effected on markets but rather within organizations. The empirical part is meant to clarify the multifarious dynamic interrelationships between markets, organizations and states in international competition. The main empirical bases are market and company studies. The course is recommended for anyone considering a career in transnational organizations. This is a 2 unit course meeting in the second second half of the quarter.\nThis course has the object of giving students basic concepts and abilities in probability and econometrics. The probability section of the course covers random variables and their moments, transformations of random variables, and moment inequalities. The econometrics sections covers linear regressions of various types and the testing of certain types of hypotheses. The course emphasizes geometrically motivated methods, such as orthogonal projection. Examples for application will be chosen from economics, finance, and accounting. The prerequisite for this course is familiarity with basic statistics, and students should be conversant with undergraduate calculus and linear algebra.\nThis course covers the linear regression model, including systems and simultaneous equations estimators. It also will introduce nonlinear regression models, maximum likelihood and generalized method-of-moments estimation. The course will emphasize both theoretical and practical issues that arise in doing empirical research. Students are expected to complete weekly problem sets and empirical projects. Familiarity with at least one advanced statistical package will be presumed. Prerequisite: E603 or Economics 270. nnnE608. Multiperson Decision Theory\nThis course presents recent research papers on economic applications of game theory. Also listed as Economics 290.\nThis course is offered for students requiring specialized training in an area not covered by existing courses. To register, a student must obtain permission from the faculty member who is willing to supervise the reading.\nThis course is elected as soon as a student is ready to begin research for the dissertation, usually shortly after admission to candidacy. To register, a student must obtain permission from the faculty member who is willing to supervise the research.\nThis course will assess the prospects for the US economy as it enters the 21st century, doing this will require looking briefly at its performance in the last 50 years, and especially at the decade of the 1990s. Attempts will be made in lectures, discussions and reading to find the salient explanations for its remarkable combination of stability and steady growth. Also attention will be paid to its shortcomings as defied by its major internal and external critics. In doing this we will examine such factors as labor force and employment, technology and productivity, fiscal and monetary policies, a structural characteristics, and foreign trade and investment. Comparisons will be drawn with other countries.  Either of two required papers but not both,  may be done with a partner. The short take-home final will be covering some of the reading and will count for 20% of the grade as opposed to 70% for the two papers.  (The remaining 10% is the quality of class contribution).\nThis course provides students with a framework for making corporate financial decisions in an international context.  The course will discuss a spectrum of topics in the area of international financial management.  Our focus will be on the markets for spot exchange, currency forwards, options, swaps, international bonds, and international equities. For each of these markets, we will study the valuation of instruments traded in these markets and, through cases, the application of these instruments to the following corporate decisions: (i) managing exposure to exchange rates, (ii) financing in international capital markets, and (iii) international capital budgeting.\nThis course addresses a number of issues in finance with particular emphasis on corporate financial management. All issues are addressed in a modern financial setting, taking specific account of the many recent innovations in the financial sector. Topics include the determinants of demand for corporate securities, risk and return trade-offs, the valuation of financial assets and liabilities, capital budgeting, corporate capital structure, dividend policy, the valuation and use of derivative securities, and risk management.\nFinance 317 develops a framework for (i) understanding the effects of taxes on business decisions and (ii) devising effective tax planning strategies. Compensation, investment, and financing policies are linked through the common fabric of the tax planning process. The course is divided into two parts. The first part develops several key concepts: we adopt a contractual perspective and emphasize the importance of considering the tax positions of all parties to contracts, both at the time of contracting and in the future. In the second part, we apply these concepts to specific business decisions. Many details of the tax law are covered along the way. You need not have taken a prior course to take this one. On the other hand, you will not be wasting your time if you have already taken a tax course. Finance 317 differs from traditional tax courses, which emphasize the rote application of tax rules to specific situations. Instead, Finance 317 focuses on the manner in which corporations and individuals can best structure their affairs in the face of an uncertain and changing environment.  Course credit may not be earned for this course and A317: Taxes and Business Strategy\nF319 is a seminar with focus on private equity investing, including venture capital.&nbsp; Private equity investing and VC are increasingly important activities.&nbsp; This seminar explores selected topics in private equity and principal investing for those MBAs who have completed the prerequisite course, F321-Investment Management and Entrepreneurial Finance, and Sloans.&nbsp; Private equity includes both established and early stage companies.&nbsp;Principal investing includes both private and public equity markets.  The course extends and deepens the entrepreneurial finance area for those with an interest in private equity, venture capital and principal investing--taking a global view which ranges over the USA and other countries.&nbsp; Utilization will be made of original case studies and lecture-discussions including visiting experts, building on the framework of F321.&nbsp; We meet with outstanding investors.&nbsp; Professor McDonald has been a partner in many private equity/venture funds since 1978.&nbsp; Additional details discussed in F321, the prerequisite course.\nEquity investment in companies, common stocks, early stage ventures, deals, partnerships, hedge funds, or other entrepreneurial opportunities will be immediately or eventually important for most MBAs. The Investment course discusses many practical and conceptual factors influencing the value of companies and deals- both publicly listed and private equityand the success of investment approaches. The focus is on quoted and private equity investments and on entrepreneurial finance. The format of the class is primarily case discussions led by Professor McDonald and principals who were involved in the case. Finance 321 enables MBAs to learn a broad investing skill-set and to study great investors. All cases for this course have been specifically developed here at the Stanford GSB by Professor McDonald. Two sections offered in the Fall Quarter.nnThe increasingly global equity markets provide the background in which investments are made and entrepreneurial businesses are financed; these markets world-wide have grown very significantly in the last decade. This course has been offered by Professor McDonald for second year MBAs in two sections of 60 each, each Fall since 1968 here at Stanford.nnAn objective of the Investment course is to equip students with the necessary tools to evaluate investment opportunities, to apply these tools in the area of publicly-listed stocks, and to analyze and evaluate private equity investments. In Finance 321 this Fall the split between public company and private equity/venture investment cases will be about 50/50.nnEach student prepares a research report on a company of his/her choice. Students interested in investment management (entrepreneurship and creating value and wealth as principal and as agent for others), private equity investing, principal investment, venture capital, corporate finance, investment banking  or other areas requiring a fundamental understanding of investments  may find this experience particularly useful. There is a community of investors who practice fundamental equity investing, with substantial success over time .\nThis course covers financial markets, instruments, and institutions, with the primary focus being on the capital raising and financing activities of firms at different stages in their life cycle. One of the critical activities a company must do well, to succeed is the raising of capital. The when, where, and how of raising capital is the focus of the course. The perspective will typically be that of a firm wishing to raise capital, though we will, quite often, also examine financing transactions from the viewpoint of the participating financial intermediary. The course begins by examining the players of the financial markets and the role of financial intermediaries. We will then analyze financing choices for younger firms, for which there exists little or no security price information, and then examine capital raising issues relevant to larger, listed firms.\nThis course provides students with a framework for making corporate financial decisions in an international context.  The course will discuss a spectrum of topics in the area of international financial management.  Our focus will be on the markets for spot exchange, currency forwards, options, swaps, international bonds, and international equities. For each of these markets, we will study the valuation of instruments traded in these markets and, through cases, the application of these instruments to the following corporate decisions: (i) managing exposure to exchange rates, (ii) financing in international capital markets, and (iii) international capital budgeting.\nThis course deals with corporate financial management.  Topics include creation of value through investment decisions, required rates of return for capital investments, exchange-rate risk exposure management, theory of corporate finance, dividend policy, financial analysis and planning, short-term, intermediate-term and long-term financing, including lease financing, financial distress, acquisitions, and leveraged buyouts.  Both conceptual and managerial aspects of the subject matter are covered.\nThis course is designed to provide a conceptual and analytic framework for addressing important issues in corporate finance.&nbsp; Topics include corporate investment and financial decisions; corporate valuation; capital budgeting and required rates of return; capital structure decisions; dividend policy; financial planning and analysis; conflicts of interest between different classes of security holders and managers; financial distress; valuation and strategic considerations in mergers and acquisitions; and lease financing.\nThis course both extends and deepens what was learned in F324, Corporate Finance. Major topic areas include: nnMarket discipline, growth and acquisitions (the market for corporate control) ; Leveraged buy outs and issuing equity-linked securities; Financial and distress restructuring including such things as spin-offs, equity carveouts, tracking stocks and distress restructurings. The central theme of the course is value creation/ transfer/destruction. The course will be conducted on a &quot;quasi seminar&quot; basis, so enrollment is limited. Cases deal with applications, and approximately 60 percent of the sessions will involve case discussions for at least part of the session. Lectures and guest speakers fill out the menu.\nThis course is an introduction to options, futures and other derivative security markets.  The goal of the course is to develop a core set of principles that will help us make sense of the diverse ways derivatives are used in practice.  These principles are developed through a series of real world examples with an emphasis on simultaneously developing intuition and familiarity with a broad spectrum of markets and institutions.  The valuation and use (e.g. hedging and speculation) of forwards, futures, swaps and options, the Black-Scholes option pricing formula, delta-hedging, Monte Carlo valuation techniques, swap pricing, valuation of corporate bonds, valuation of real options such as real estate, risk management with options and futures, and VAR (value-at-risk).\nThis course considers strategies that investors can employ to meet various investment objectives. A significant part of the course will be focused on the asset allocation decision and the overall management of the risk and return characteristics of a portfolio. In particular the course will explore many of the more quantitative approaches to portfolio optimization and identifying investing opportunities. The course will address the full scope of the investment management problem by considering investment across all classes of securities (equities, fixed-income instruments, derivatives, etc.) in both domestic and foreign markets; the use of dynamic strategies to control risks and to achieve investment goals; and empirical studies of security returns and models of the determinants of asset prices. Another part of the course will examine the investment management industry and consider issues related to performance measurement, the compensation of portfolio managers, and regulation. Some outside speakers who are practitioners will speak to the class concerning the current practice in the industry and industry trends.\nNeed approval from sponsoring faculty member and GSB Registrar.\nThis second-year one-week seminar will present roughly one topic on investments each day for 5 days.  The objective is to provide some sound information on certain investment strategies that are important to successful individual or institutional investors, but which may be difficult to learn about from standard sources.\nThis course presents and develops many of the important concepts in financial economics. The major focus is on single-period models of financial markets and the valuation of simple financial claims traded in those markets. In part of the course, models of choice under uncertainty, risk aversion, and stochastic dominance are discussed, and single-period portfolio optimization problems are examined. Several equilibrium models of asset markets are then presented. These include the Arrow-Debreu model of complete markets, the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), and Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT). In addition, mutual fund separation theorems and aggregation theorems are presented. These are followed by a brief introduction to multiperiod asset markets and portfolio choice in a multiperiod context. In the last part of the course, the financial decisions of firms are considered and the Modigliani-Miller theorems are presented.\nThe goal of this course is to introduce students to existing empirical work in financial economics as well as to illustrate the use of econometric methods in analysis of financial data. Topics include measurement problems and tests of asset valuation models, including stocks, bonds, and foreign exchange.\nThis course considers a broad spectrum of topics relating to corporate finance and the theory of the firm. Topics include capital structure decisions, dividend policy, security design and voting rights, corporate governance and the market for corporate control, optimal financial contracting, internal organization of the firm, and managerial reputation. Primary focus will be on how asymmetric information, agency conflicts, strategic interactions, and incomplete contracting affect corporate financial decision-making. The course aims both to familiarize students with current research and to promote new research ideas in the area.\nThis seminar examines the impact of taxes on security values and investment strategies at a graduate level. The readings and discussion will focus on a variety of instruments including equities, bonds, and various derivative instruments. The seminar will incorporate three perspectives on the ensuing tax and finance issues: (1) a planning or &quot;trading strategy&quot; perspective ? appropriate for advising investors; (2) a market perspective ? especially, the impact of taxes on security prices; (3) a tax policy perspective ? focusing on the government's choice of rules. The seminar also will devote time to some methodological issues that arise from each perspective. Although there are no formal prerequisites, knowledge of finance at a basic graduate level is assumed. Some of the material relies on continuous time modeling, but a deep knowledge of this type of modeling is not required\nThis course is offered for students requiring specialized training in an area not covered by existing courses.

Various aspects of real estate are covered, including economics, market analysis, finance, taxation, appraisal, investment analysis, investment vehicles, development, planning, merchandising and property management.  Major land uses are discussed, including residential, retail, office, and industrial projects.  This course is designed for both the investor and the general manager to better understand real estate as an asset class.\nThis course will examine how market forces can be harnessed to encourage private solutions to environmental concerns.  It will use case studies to show how innovative contracting must be combined entrepreneurial visions if environmental entrepreneurship is to be successful.  The course will draw on economic theories of principal-agent problems and contracting and on case studies of &quot;enviro-capitalists.&quot;  Students will learn how for- profit and not-for-profit organizations are using market forces by developing innovative contracts that specify the environmental products that are desired, the mechanisms for payment, and the contributions from input suppliers.  In cases where governmental regulations stand in the way of private contracting, we will discuss how these barriers can be overcome.  We will consider cases dealing with land, water, and wildlife resources and cases dealing with the tougher problems of air and water quality.  Most cases will be from U.S. firms, but we will also consider international examples.  Students will hear directly from environmental entrepreneurs and will have an opportunity to develop their own case studies of enviro-capitalism.  This course will be useful for people who are seeking ways to have a direct impact on improving the environment or to those who expect to work within businesses where environmental concerns affect everyday decisions.\nThe operational/execution issues that startups face from their genesis to an IPO or other major liquidity event. Issues include deciding the organization structure, working with infrastructure providers, designing information systems, and the promotion of rapid sustainable growth. Law firms, accounting firms, incubators, venture capital firms, human resource firms, public relations firms, and marketing firms. Cases, readings, and guest speakers from infrastructure providers and startups.nnWin, Spr (Foster)\nStartups have adopted dramatically different approaches to considering the global marketplace. This course will examine these different approaches and how they are being employed in different industries and in different continents.nnnThe different modules of the course include: (A) Global Strategies of the Startup Financing Community. Silicon Valley has long been viewed as being Silicon Valley centric, both in its focus on Silicon-Valley headquartered companies and its focus on startups emphasizing on U.S. markets (at least initially). This now is undergoing much change. For example, several Tier I V.C.'s (for example, Benchmark) have set up separate European funds. We will explore these changes, the factors underlying them, and their impact on startup strategies. (B) Regional-Based Financing Funds Designed to Exploit Globalization. Recent new funds (from News Corp, and Softbank among others) have as their rationale the exporting of ideas from one country to other continents. Included here will be an analysis of contracting issues for startups and how geographic-restricted &quot;domains&quot; can be awarded for off-line vis-&agrave;-vis on-line products. (C) Global Strategies of Incubators and Networking Groups. Efforts by Anderson Consulting, Softbank, and First Tuesday will be examined. (D) Infrastructure Providers Aiming to Lubricate Globalization. Many intermediaries exist to make introductions, structure international agreements, assist in understanding local markets, and so on. Legal cases on franchising will be examined as well as contracting issues in joint ventures, licensing and other approaches will be discussed. (E) Case Studies of Inter-Continent and Intra-Continent Based Expansion Strategies of Startups. Case studies from both the on-line and off-line world will be examined. One set of cases will examine the U.S. entry strategies of startups initially founded in Europe, Asia, Latin America and the Pacific Region. Another set of cases will examine the &quot;export&quot; strategies of U.S. based startups into Europe, Asia, Latin America and the Pacific Region. A third set of cases will examine startups that have a global strategy from day 0. The course grade will be based on a group project and two individual hand-ins (a case and an assignment).\nNeed approval from sponsoring faculty member and GSB Registrar.\nWe are excited to announce that the following speakers will address you throughout this lecture series:nnJennifer Aaker: Associate Professor of Marketing and A.

It is conducted throughout the year and covers a range of activities. These include formal sessions in which the tasks of leaders and leadership styles are explored. Sloan Fellows have the opportunity to complete a personal preference inventory instrument, which is coupled with team building exercises. Formal sessions are enhanced by presentations from distinguished Stanford faculty with a focus on issues of leadership, power and politics, and other topics of broad relevance. nnCEOs and Chairmen of major corporations are invited to meet with Sloan Fellows in Top Management Seminars, in which they discuss leadership issues in their own organizations. Sloan Fellows have the opportunity for an informal exchange of views with the speaker and further discussion over dinner. nnMeetings with leaders of business and government are the focus of the domestic and international field trips. These include meetings in Silicon Valley and Seattle, as well as New York and Washington. At the conclusion of the program, Sloan Fellows also participate in an international field trip where they meet with leaders in other countries.\nThis course will examine the diverse management challenges facing the sports industry. The course will cover issues at the league level, the team level, the athlete/agent level, and the college level. The diverse constituencies with interests in sports issues (athletes, fans, media companies, advertisers, and legislators to name a few) will be discussed. Sports issues at a global level (the IOC) and both U.S. and outside U.S. will be covered. nnThis is a 2 unit course meeting in the second half of the quarter.\nThrough selected readings, case studies, and discussion, this seminar will explore the nature and role of leadership.  We will address such topics as: nn1.  What is leadership?  What do leaders do?  How do leaders perform their role?nn2.  What determines a leader's success or failure?nn3.  Is there a difference between managing and leading?nn4.  Are leaders born or made?nnReadings will attempt to draw on multi-disciplinary explorations of this topic.\nThis seminar examines research on the psychology of judgment and choice. Although the normative issue of how decisions should be made is relevant, the descriptive issue of how decisions are made is the main focus of the course. Topics of discussion include choice, judgment heuristics and biases, decision framing, prospect theory, mental accounting, context effects, task effects, regret, and other topics. The goal of the seminar is twofold: to foster a critical appreciation of existing knowledge in behavioral decision theory, to develop the students' skills in identifying and testing interesting research ideas, and to explore research opportunities for adding to that knowledge.\nThis course investigates the issues facing investors contemplating investments in areas affected by Federal, state, local or transnational government regulation.  The course will first consider the economic rationale for regulation, the growth of regulatory requirements, and the mechanics, timing, and nature of the regulatory process.  Through case studies, discussion and guest lecturers, the course will then examine some of the key issues arising when investing in telecommunications, biotechnology, environmental protection, natural resources, and energy - all areas significantly influenced by the presence of regulation.  Regulation will be examined both as a source of invesment risk and as a source of competitive advantage.  Finally, the course will contemplate new forms and methods of both domestic and international regulation which may become more prevalent in the future.\nThis course will provide a foundation for the ethical and social problems involved in running a biotechnology company.  Additionally, it will introduce students to how biotechnology companies are formed, how they interact with research physicians, how they are financed, the new technologies that are being developed, how product R&amp;D is managed, what regulatory hurdles exist and the issues involved in marketing a biotechnology product.  Classes will feature guest speakers, including professors from the business and medical schools, venture capitalists, business executives, regulators, and others who can provide insight and expertise to the issue being addressed.  This is a 2 unit course that meets once a week.\nThis course is offered for students requiring specialized training in an area not covered by existing courses. To register, a student must obtain permission from the faculty member who is willing to supervise the reading.\nThis course provides a framework for understanding and thinking strategically about employment relations and the management of human resources in organizations. The course draws on insights from the social sciences to explore how employment relations are influenced by economic, social, psychological, legal, and cultural forces. Specific topics include: recruitment and selection; performance evaluation; compensation and benefits; promotion, job design; training; layoffs; retention and turnover; and the human resource implications of various strategies.\nThis course provides a framework for understanding and thinking strategically about employment relations and the management of human resources in organizations.

Additional sessions are likely to include more details of incentive pay, organizational change, and downsizing. There will be a required problem set, which will be fairly analytical.nnOPTION 2: Section 2, another version of HRMGT 281 will focus on some of the challenges with founding, growing, and changing commitment-based firms. These cases will include several emerging companies, several growth firms, and an established strong culture company facing significant change.  Several executives from these companies will join the class to discuss some of the management challenges. nnOPTION 3: Section 3 of HRMGT 281 will be similar to section 2 and overlap in some topics and cases.  However, this section will differ from section 2 in placing more emphasis on: (1) some of the HR issues and challenges faced by knowledge-intensive organizations, especially in their early stages; and (2) how HR practices and policies are shaped by the cultural, legal, and institutional environment (e.g., U.S. versus non-U.S., for-profit versus not-for-profit, unionized versus non-union settings).\nThis course provides a framework for understanding and thinking strategically about employment relations and the management of human resources in organizations.

Specific topics include: recruitment and selection; performance evaluation; compensation and benefits; promotion, job design; training; layoffs; retention and turnover; and the human resource implications of various strategies.\nThis course is designed to teach the student how to use economics to solve practical personnel problems that affect worker productivity. Topics include: selecting the best workers to hire, training workers, turnover, setting compensation strategically, structuring salespersons commissions, downsizing, using promotions as an incentive mechanism, and other topics. Examples and cases will be presented to demonstrate the importance of using economic techniques to structure human resources programs.nnThe course will appeal most to the student who expects to be a general manager or who hopes to run his or her own business. Although the human resources specialist may benefit from this course, the emphasis will be on decisions that affect personnel, but are made primarily by general managers. The class format is somewhat unusual. Most classes consist of lecture with questions, but two are class workshops. The lecture will present a theoretical development of a topic. The questions discussed during the last part of the lecture period will involve practical business application of the theory presented in lecture. This course is more technical than other human resources courses, but should be accessible to anyone who has successfully completed the economics and statistics courses in the MBA core. Every student is expected to know calculus and basic probability and statistics. Although I will not emphasize the technical aspects on the final exam, the problem sets will require some knowledge of mathematics. To ease your fears, many poets have taken variants of this course in the past and have done well.nnThere will be graded team problem sets and a final exam.\nNeed approval from sponsoring faculty member and GSB Registrar.\nThis course is offered for students requiring specialized training in an area not covered by existing courses. To register, a student must obtain permission from the faculty member who is willing to supervise the reading.\nThis course is elected as soon as a student is ready to begin research for the dissertation, usually shortly after admission to candidacy. To register, a student must obtain permission from the faculty member who is willing to supervise the research.\nThe objectives of this course are to introduce students to the substantive and procedural aspects of marketing management and to sharpen skills for critical analytical thinking and effective communication. Specifically, the goals are to introduce students to marketing strategy and to the elements of marketing analysis: customer analysis, competitor analysis, and company analysis; to familiarize students with the elements of the marketing mix (product strategy, pricing, advertising and promotion, and distribution), and to enhance problem solving and decision-making abilities in these operational areas of marketing; and to provide students with a forum (both written and verbal) for presenting and defending their own recommendations, and for critically examining and discussing the recommendations of others.\nThis course is aimed at the manager who is the ultimate user of research and who is responsible for determining the scope and direction of research activities conducted on his/her behalf. The main objective is to help you recognize the role of systematic information gathering in providing sound decision guidance and develop an appreciation for the potential contributions and limitations of market research data. Marketing research is simply an organized way of developing and providing information for decision making purposes. The quality of the information, for example its validity and reliability, depends on the care exercised in executing the various steps of the marketing research process. These steps include problem definition, research design (exploratory, descriptive and causal), data collection methods, questionnaire design and attitude measurement, sampling schemes, and data analysis. In this course emphasis will be given to both qualitative and quantitative aspects of marketing research and how they help managers in addressing substantive marketing problems such as: market segmentation, estimating market potential, forecasting market demand, developing advertising and pricing policies and designing and positioning new products.\nHow do consumers of all kinds decide what products and services they want, need, and desire?  What principles of consumer behavior can be used to design a &quot;customer-focused organization&quot;. In this course we examine consumer psychology from a managerial perspective, focusing on understanding and serving consumer needs to create satisfied and loyal customers. We first develop basic frameworks of consumer behavior principles and then apply these frameworks to a number of specific content domains, including cultural and national differences in buying and advertising, internet commerce, medical and financial services marketing, new product adoption, and consumer attitudes to biotechnology. A major theme of the course is the diversity of consumer behavior across cultures, nations, and subcultures. The course will make heavy use of television and print advertisements for discussion and analysis as well as video presentations of consumer behavior in different cultures and settings. Guest lecturers involved in sub-culture targeted marketing campaigns will be included when possible. The course is relevant to anyone interested in the interplay between human nature and business practices.\nThis course will provide the background and analytical skills necessary to place you at the forefront of strategic design and effective  management of distribution channels.  We begin with an in-depth consideration of channel design. This involves the appropriate determination of channel structure (e.g., direct vs. indirect), channel organization (make vs buy) and intensity (intensive vs exclusive). Our goals are to understand the major types of channel structures and the underlying forces that affect survival and success.  Like all aspects of marketing, channels are subject to continuous pressures for change. Oftentimes success requires the development of new and innovative forms of distribution organization.  We will consider such ongoing channel management issues along with compensation and co-marketing programs.  There will be a term project in which groups of students will be asked to locate a local firm and perform a channel audit on this firm or a part of it.  Groups are expected to produce progress reports and a final report.\nThis course is designed to develop the knowledge, skills and perspectives to support the application of traditional marketing concepts (e.g. developing a customer orientation, segmentation, and using marketing information) to non-profit, public sector and social change organizations. Additionally, the course addresses the use of social marketing, private sector collaborations (e.g. cause-related marketing) and public policy to improve social welfare. nnThe course aims to provide an understanding of the specific issues and dynamics of the unique marketing challenges within this domain. The course also intends to develop the students' abilities to analyze problems and create effective strategies for the marketing of social products, services, organizations and ideas. Finally, the course attempts to create an understanding of specific marketing resources and tools, including audience development, fundraising, and volunteerism. nnThe course will be based primarily on in-class discussion of assigned readings, analysis of illustrative case studies and consideration of issues emerging within the assigned group projects. Additionally, the class will incorporate interactive in-class assignments and guest speakers. The course is designed primarily for MBA's whose career goals involve working in or with non-profit and/or public sector organizations, or who want to have better knowledge regarding how such organizations achieve their marketing goals. Further, M358 is for students interested in understanding the role and application of marketing beyond private and commercial gain, to promote social change.\nThe Net of 2002 continues to evolve rapidly.  Important new capabilities are replacing the hype of an earlier era.  The Internet is THE real-time direct link to customers and constituencies. This course mixes industry insights, theoretical approaches, research findings, industry data and hands-on experience to better understand and implement successful Internet marketing. There is an emphasis on both new opportunities and how existing organizations can best combine the Net with traditional tools. The course begins with a framework for understanding the fundamental drivers of Net marketing opportunities.  We then consider a number of Net marketing themes; such as information-based marketing, the rise of wireless, on-line quality enhancement, personalization, community building, real time marketing, and customer management on-line. Important implementation tools are developed.Building traffic to a site is one of the main jobs of an on-line marketer. We investigate branding, public relations, advertising, email, and word-of-mouth methods of acquiring and retaining visitors. There is a strong focus on success metrics and profitability for these traffic-building efforts.  The Net raises challenges for many companies, including channel conflict and appropriate transitional methods. The Internet exposes many company weaknesses, and creates pressure to re-organize and improve the marketing organization.  To study these issues we combine lecture material, readings, material from a text by the instructor (revised), case discussions, on-line examples, discussions with top industry leaders, and actual development tasks. We use online courseware to give each student experience with actual data and typical decisions faced by Net marketers in a range of business settings. Team projects to design an on-line service or product, or to improve an existing on-line presence, are also an important component of the course.\nSpecial Topics: Business Research\nSecuring product placement in retail chains and forging alliances with retailers is a critical marketing function.  This course provides several of the analytical tools and templates for achieving this.  We will examine from the retailer's perspective the marketing and financial strategies underlying retail formats and across grocery, apparel, specialty and department stores segments of the retailing industry.  We will examine the strategic choice between EDLP and Hi-Lo pricing.  We examine the frameworks that retailers use to plan, select and manage product assortments, price and promote them through the life cycle and the rise of what the trade press refers to as 'Rocket Science Retailing'.  We conclude with an analysis of the e-tailing wars and the emergence of integrated multi-channel retailing.  Lecture/case/discussion format with visiting lectures by industry leaders and a team research project.\nThe focus of the seminar is on understanding current theoretical and methodological approaches to various aspects of cultural psychology, particularly in the context of consumer behavior.  A secondary goal is to advance this knowledge by developing testable hypotheses, theoretical perspectives and marketing implications that build on the current knowledge base.  Thus, the class will be similar to a Ph.D. seminar where the focus is on reviewing and discussing a set of academic articles that focus on culture and persuasion, understanding the methodologies used in the articles and discussing the marketing implications of the findings in the articles.\nThis seminar examines useful quantitative models and methods relevant to product planning, pricing and promotion, and marketing strategy. Topics include conjoint analysis and measurement of preference structures, LOGIT choice models, information search, product strategy and brand equity, marketing strategy, new product introduction, market structuring, and new product diffusion.\nObjectives are to (1) familiarize you with research in cultural psychology, particularly in the context of consumer behavior, and (2) build a set of academic-oriented skills (e.g., critical thinking, presentations, review process, creating hypotheses and testing them creatively). Specifically, the focus is on understanding current theoretical and methodological approaches to various aspects of culture and persuasion, as well as advancing this knowledge by developing testable hypotheses and theoretical perspectives that build on the current knowledge base. The content of the course (e.g., readings) represent basic and recent work in cultural psychology and related disciplines (psychology, anthropology and sociology).\nThis course is offered for students requiring specialized training in an area not covered by existing courses. To register, a student must obtain permission from the faculty member who is willing to supervise the reading.\nThe objective of this course is to understand customer preferences, perceptions, and behaviors for product planning (and, to some extent, pricing decisions). A dominant paradigm in the course is to conceptualize customers as choosing among products and services based on product positioning on multiple attributes/features. Methods for measuring customers' preference trade-offs, perceptions, and trial and repeat purchase behaviors are emphasized. Topics include: Conjoint Analysis (an approach to measuring the values customers place on various product features), and related methods; their use in determining benefit segments, and in evaluating alternative product and pricing decisions; methods for understanding customer perceptions and brand equity; simulated and real test markets for predicting the likely success of new products; and customer adoption of new product categories. This course is particularly appropriate for careers in marketing, management consulting, and product development. The course project is a critical part of the course requirement and is to be done by self-selected four-person teams. The project will involve &quot;Conjoint Analysis&quot; - an assessment of the values customers place on various attributes of a product. Each team will collect and analyze data drop from a sample of 40 respondents. The &quot;product&quot; can be industrial or consumer, durable or non-durable, product or service that is of interest to the team members.\nThis course is designed to increase students' understanding of the key issues, theories and tools used to make marketing communication decisions within new world realities. Specifically, the course aims to provide analytical skills useful for the planning, implementation and evaluation of marketing communication campaigns. The course also intends to identify the role of advertising as it relates to other marketing functions, particularly other promotional activities. Finally, the course attempts to provide a conceptual understanding of the social, global and legal environment in whch marketing communications are implemented. The course is targeted to students who anticipate managing the development of advertising or other marketing communications whether as a marketing manager, ad agency personnel, or as an entrepreneur. If you desire to learn how to make strategic marketing communication decisions, Mktg 347 is an appropriate course for you.\nThe three basic topics in this course are: (a) quantitative modeling in a spreadsheet environment; (b) optimization models; and (c) discrete-event (Monte Carlo) simulation. In part (a), students will translate verbal descriptions of managerial situations, in which varying amounts of data are embedded, into spreadsheet models suitable for &quot;running and numbers.&quot; Part (b) focuses on linear and non-linear programming applications in marketing, operations, and finance. Part (c) emphasis is on model formulation and the interpretation of results, rather than mathematical theory.\nThis course focuses on basic managerial issues arising in the operations of both manufacturing and service industries. The objectives of the course are to familiarize students with the problems and issues confronting operations managers and to introduce language, conceptual models, and analytical techniques that are broadly applicable in confronting such problems. The spectrum of different process types used to provide goods and services is developed and then examined through methods of process analysis and design.\nThis course introduces the fundamental concepts and techniques for analyzing risk and formulating sound decisions in uncertain environments. Approximately half of the course focuses on probability theory and decision analysis, including decision trees, decision criteria, the value of information, and simulation techniques. The remainder of the course examines statistical methods for interpreting and analyzing data including sampling concepts, regression analysis, and hypothesis testing. Applications include inventory management, demand analysis, lotteries and gambling, portfolio analysis, insurance, auctions, surveys and opinion polls, environmental contamination, failure analysis and quality control. The course emphasizes analytical techniques and concepts that are broadly applicable to business problems.\nThis course introduces modeling and managerial uses of computers for decision making. Three major themes are developed: (1) the building, using, and interpretation of computer-based models that aid managers in making decisions; (2) the analysis and interpretation of empirical data for use in computer-based models; and (3) the building and use of organization-wide information systems combining technology, data, and models for decision support. Extensive use is made of Excel spreadsheet software on a personal computer for &quot;hands-on&quot; assignments.\nThis course will focus on collecting, organizing, and using data as an aid to making managerial decisions. It has two related threads. The first focuses on advanced statistical and machine learning techniques for data analysis. The second is concerned with business data base organization and construction. Students will manipulate and use large data sets that they will collect from corporate sources, field projects, or library files. Topics include: advanced regression analysis, analysis of time series, forecasting, discriminate analysis, classification trees, clustering, neural networks, relational data bases, data mining, and data warehousing. This course can be considered as a follow-on to two core courses-- The Data and Decisions Course and the Management in an Information Age course. It covers advanced data analysis techniques, and issues of collecting and organizing data in data warehouses. This is a &quot;learn by doing&quot; course, with lots of hands-on use of software. In particular, four software packages will be used in the course. Two group projects are involved -- one to make a presentation to the class on some aspect of data mining. The second involves collecting a large data set and applying the techniques of the course to &quot;mine&quot; it.\nThis course addresses how product-based firms that operate within a supply chain can create a sustainable competitive advantage.  Doing so requires developing and managing competitive processes for designing, producing, and delivering products.  It also requires developing a competitive position within the supply chain, so that other firms in that network find it desirable and profitable to do business with you.  In short, you must establish a competitive position in the factor markets as well as in the product markets.  Market power may reside, in different degrees, at various points in the value chain.  Positioning may involve a complex mixture of both services and products.  The course focuses on developing a framework and set of concepts that are useful in establishing a competitive position in these markets and managing the relationships with suppliers and partners.  nnTo accomplish this there will be segments of the course on the scope of the enterprise, on strategies for managing a network of suppliers, and on product and process development. The objectives of the course are to (1) help you understand how comparative advantage can be created through positioning in factor markets and markets for intermediate products; and (2) provide you with tools and concepts that would help you manage the relationships in these markets including the contracting process.\nThe course is designed for students with liberal arts or soft science backgrounds.  Students with hard science, engineering, or computer science backgrounds are welcome, but must tolerate levels of coverage with less rigor than they are used to.  Also, they must avoid redirecting the class discussion into narrow or advanced material that causes dysfunction to less technical colleagues.Students will build web pages.  Separate training is doing this is offered.\nFirms in many industries are scrambling to develop innovative ways to move products from raw materials through manufacturing to customers more quickly and efficiently. Some are responding by necessity to competition, both domestically and internationally. Others are capitalizing on the continuing stream of dramatic improvements in information technology. They redesign their supply chains to gather, process, transmit, share, and exploit vast amounts of information quickly and cheaply. Still others are applying the radically different philosophy of seeking a cooperative approach among all the players in the supply chain. Huge improvements have been enjoyed by firms able to optimize over their entire supply chains and figure out how to share the resulting gains while breaking down the traditional adversarial relationships. Some redesign their chains to bypass unneeded stages. Other innovations derive from deregulation and lower tariffs. This course examines many of the recent innovations in this area.\nThe e-Business Process Foundry will be a project-based course in which cross-disciplinary teams will produce prototypes of operating business processes that utilize web technologies. Each team's project must demonstrate (1) the user interface(s), (2) the system architecture, including components, necessary server-side features, and programming interfaces, and (3) the connections and capabilities necessary to ensure reliable fulfillment/delivery of the non-virtual services or goods. nnFor the 2001-2002 academic year, the course will focus on using web technologies to enhance the capabilities of local non-profit agencies. We hope to have a set of six to ten potential client organizations ready to work with teams as the course starts, so that teams can coalesce quickly around shared interests and launch their projects immediately. While the projects will differ in focus and context, we expect some common themes to emerge, so that each team can critique and contribute to other teams' ideas. Projects will share the common purpose of using web technologies (and the associated network externalities and information aggregation opportunities) to get a real job done; constructing an attractive and innovative web site may be part of the story, but our emphasis is on using technology to extend an organization's ability to deliver real service. nnTeams will make regular presentations and progress reports to the class and various industry experts. Teams will be graded on both the quality of their own process prototypes and their contributions to the success of the course as a whole. nnEach team will consist of four to six students from the Graduate School of Business, the Computer Science Department, and the Electrical Engineering Department. Each team should include individuals with technical knowledge of databases, scripting languages, and web servers, as well as business knowledge of the non-virtual processes that provide real goods and services. For EE and CS students, CS141 will be an ideal preparatory course; CS145, CS241 and CS193I will be useful. For GSB students, OIT255 and OI T262 are prerequisites and OIT361 will be useful. nnClass size will be limited and admission will be managed through instructor permission.\nNeed approval from sponsoring faculty member and GSB Registrar.\nTopics in Business Research\nThis seminar exposes students to manufacturing topics not covered in traditional courses and that are needed to help them prepare for academic careers in manufacturing. Topics are chosen by the students, who develop many of the presentations and lead many of the discussions. The seminar also features guest speakers from government, industry, and academia. Intended primarily for the Future Professors of Manufacturing, but open to others with permission of the instructor. Also listed as General Engineering 616E.\nThis course is offered for students requiring specialized training in an area not covered by existing courses. To register, a student must obtain permission from the faculty member who is willing to supervise the reading.\nThis course is elected as soon as a student is ready to begin research for the dissertation, usually shortly after admission to candidacy. To register, a student must obtain permission from the faculty member who is willing to supervise the research.\nThis course relates existing theory and research to organizational problems by reviewing basic concepts in the following areas: individual motivation and behavior, interpersonal communication and influence, small group behavior, intergroup conflict and cooperation, organizational structure, and relations between organizations and environments. The course focuses on the ways in which organizations and their members affect one another and exposes students to conflicting frameworks for diagnosing and dealing with problems in organizational settings.\nTo realize his or her goals, a manager must be able to access information and resources, influence others, and have a strong understanding of the causes and consequences of organizational change. Through case discussion and theoretically informed readings, this course investigates the formal and informal underpinnings of access, influence, and change in organizations.\nThis course relates behavioral science knowledge to problems of organizational life. The course covers basic concepts in the following areas: individual behavior, interpersonal communication and influence, small group behavior, intergroup conflict and cooperation, organizational structure, and relations between organizations and environments. Its purpose is to help the student diagnose problems in organizational settings and assess the probable consequences of various types of organizational interventions. The first weeks of the course focus chiefly on individual, interpersonal, and small-group issues. In the concluding weeks, the scope widens to include issues of intergroup relationships and the design and functioning of complex organizations.\nAlthough many leadership approaches will achieve good performance, it is the premise of this course that the assumptions underlying traditional approaches to leadership frequently blocks excellence.  This course will present a new approach that sees leadership as a joint responsibility of members and the leader.  Implementing this new definition requires strong teams, shared vision and mutual influence relationships. Class time will be spent describing this approach and exploring how both leaders and members can build such teams, make vision real and relevant and develop mutual influence relationships.  Through the use of video, = written cases and in-class role-plays, the specifics of how to build a high performance unit will be discussed.  Although most of the time will be spent on the leader dealing with direct reports, attention will also be paid to the other two leadership functions of dealing sidewards and upwards.In addition to class time, students will be randomly assigned to 7-person Skill Development groups that will meet for two and a half hours on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, evening or Wednesday day.  (Student preferences will be taken into account in making the group assignments.)  Role-plays and critical incidents will let students increase their competencies in implementing this leadership model by trying out various approaches and receiving peer feedback.  Students will rotate responsibility for planning and conducting these sessions.  Their will also be a group project.\nThe focus of this course is to increase one's competencies in building more effective relationships. Learning is primarily through feedback from other group members. This course is very involving and, at times, can be quite emotional. However, this is not a substitute for therapy; we deal more with inter-personal issues than with intra-personal. (If you are in therapy, please talk this over with your counselor and get that person's advice before enrolling in this course.) The 36 students in the class are randomly divided into three 12-person T-groups that meet one evening a week over the term. In addition, the class goes away for a weekend around the seventh week of the course. Because of the highly interactive nature of this course, it is very important that all students attend all&nbsp;sessions. The 1st meeting of all 3 T-groups will be the first full week of classes.\nPower and influence processes are pervasive and important in organizations, so leaders need to be able both to understand power and to act on that knowledge.  Moreover, many people are ambivalent about power, its acquisition, and use.  Therefore, the course has three objectives: 1) increasing students' ability to diagnose and analyze power and politics as they occur in actual situations; this includes enhancing clinical skills;  2) increasing students' ability to exercise power effectively; and 3) helping students come to terms with the inherent dilemmas and choices involved in developing and exercising influence--in other words, deciding on your personal &quot;path to power.&quot;  Topics covered include: sources of power; dealing with resistance and obstacles; obtaining allies and supporters; maintaining power; preparing oneself to obtain power; diagnosing the political landscape; and the use of language and symbolism in exercising power.\nPower and influence processes are pervasive and important in organizations, so leaders need to be able both to understand power and to act on that knowledge.  Therefore, the course has three objectives: 1) increasing students' ability to diagnose and analyze power and politics; 2) increasing skills in exercising power effectively; and 3) helping students come to terms with the inherent dilemmas and choices involved in developing and exercising influence.  Topics covered include: sources of power; dealing with resistance and obstacles; obtaining allies and supporters; maintaining power; preparing oneself to obtain power; diagnosing the political landscape; and the use of language and symbolism in exercising power. &nbsp;\nConflict is inherent in organizations. Conflict arises whenever independent parties - individuals, departments, organizations - must secure an agreement. Parties involved face a decision between competitive and cooperative solutions: Will competition bring a favorable result or will it escalate to dysfunctional levels? Will cooperation foster a valuable working relationship or will it leave an underlying problem unresolved?nnThis course presents a variety of frameworks for analyzing conflicts and techniques for resolving conflicts. Many dimensions of conflict are discussed, including relevant psychological, interpersonal, game theoretical, organizational, and cultural dynamics. This course reviews strategy and tactics in various conflict resolution procedures, including bargaining, distributive and integrative negotiation, mediation, and arbitration. A conceptual understanding is of little use, however, without understanding of how to put strategy and tactics into practice. To this end, considerable emphasis will be placed on exercises and role-play simulations of conflicts designed to develop students' negotiation skills.\nThis course explores how social networks can be used to advance careers, improve team effectiveness and organizational performance. Drawing on concepts and findings in the area of social network theory, this course examines how an individual's position in the network affects his or her access to new information, autonomy and ability to wield power. These ideas are applied in two contexts: (i) challenges faced by new managers, particularly during organizational change, (ii) networks between organizations including strategic alliances and third-party endorsements\nWomen in Organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;This course will use business cases, videos, exercises, class discussions, and guest speakers to explore a variety of issues relevant to womens working experiences in managerial and professional positions, including the effects of proportions of men and women in a job, how to shape human resource policies and organizational cultures that motivate employees with differing needs, how networking strategies of men and women differ, the realities of starting your own business (an option women are increasingly choosing), maximizing the fairness of promotions and pay, coping with gender-related difficultiesin work situations. Problems unique to minority women will be examined. For each of these topics, a variety of solutions will be discussed, so each student can develop their own individual approach, tailored to the individual situations they anticipate facing. Students will be given considerable latitude in designing individual projects and papers that reflect their interests.  This course is also listed in the Sociology Department as SOC 261-B.\nAnnouncement to All First- and Second- Year GSB StudentsnnnSpring Quarter WorkshopnnnWorking in the Entertainment IndustriesnnPresent Realities, Future Possibilities&quot;nnnBill Guttentag, an Academy- and Emmy- Award winning writer, director, and producer, along with Rod Kramer, the William R. Kimball Professor of Organizational Behavior in the Graduate School of Business, will be offering for the second time a 4 unit workshop on the entertainment industry in the Spring 2002 quarter.  The workshop will meet once a week on Mondays from 3:20-6:50.  The workshop is intended for anyone interested in careers in the film, cable, or television industries.nnnWe launched this new workshop last year and it turned out to be a wonderful experience. The class speakers from last year included the actress Sigourney Weaver; Dick Wolf (Executive Producer, Law &amp; Order); Casey Silver (former CEO of Universal); director Jan de Bont (Twister, Speed); Phil Rosenthal (creator and executive producer of Everybody Loves Raymond); Tom King, entertainment reporter for The Wall Street Journal); Nina Jacobson, president of Buena Vista-Disney Pictures; independent producer Ed Pressman (Reversal of Fortune, Wall Street, American Psycho); Hank Barry (CEO of Napster); as well as a number of number of prominent agents, lawyers, and film and TV executives. This year we will have some returning speakers and a host of new speakers.nnnOverview of the workshop: The workshop will be very &quot;hands on&quot; in the sense that a major focus of the workshop will be student projects designed to help students learn more about the &quot;nuts and bolts&quot; of working in these industries, and also how to develop and pursue career paths in these industries.  We want to emphasize, therefore, that this workshop will not resemble the usual second-year GSB elective, in terms of either process or content.  For example, it will not be a survey course.  We will have readings, cases, and a few &quot;mini-lectures&quot; from Bill and I about various features of the industry (e.g., pitching ideas, deal-making).  We will also have a number of guest speakers, including leading players in these industries (agents, writers, actors, studio executives, etc.).  However, the focus of the workshop is on helping each student develop his or her own career interests and projects (either individually or in teams).  It is intended, therefore, to foster individual and group project development within the context of an intense and enjoyable small group setting.  Therefore, Bill and I will function as project facilitators as much as traditional course instructors.nnnThe workshop is open to both first- and second- year MBA students. In fact, we particularly welcome first-year MBA students interested in pursuing careers in these industries, as this might be a great way to begin thinking about your summer internships.  Enrollment in the workshop will be via the usual bidding process at GSB.  We have set a &quot;cap&quot; of 56 MBA students for the workshop size, in order to keep it small enough to allow a fairly intimate collaborative relationships among the students, and also to focus on working with individuals with fairly well-developed career plans and project ideas.  Again, this is not designed as a &quot;survey&quot; or &quot;introductory&quot; level course, but a workshop, so the projects and class discussions will be a central part of the learning experience.nnnWorkshop requirements: Workshop requirements include 1) completion of a substantial term project (along the lines of a serious 390 independent study project) of the student's own choosing by the end of the quarter and 2) active workshop participation throughout the quarter.nnnWe plan to make this a terrific and unique learning opportunity for Stanford students.  We hope you will be interested in joining us.\nThis course is designed to help students improve their capacity to understand and manage human systems, exercise leadership and work effectively and humanely with other people, specifically within the context of culturally diverse groups and organizations.  The class will address two primary questions: 1) What obstacles persist in organizations and groups that prevent people from participating fully, working effectively, and developing relationships and alliances in the context of diversity?  2) What can people do to create conditions in which diversity can enhance learning and effectiveness within groups and organizations? The course is experiential; students should be prepared to experiment with various conceptual and analytic skills inside and outside of the classroom. There will be opportunities for students to explore a variety of dimensions of identity and difference in organizations, including (but not limited to)  race, ethnicity, gender, nationality, sexual identity, physical ability, class, and religion.  The course will use the classrooms as a lab for testing and extending conceptual material.  The course is intended for students who expect to work in culturally diverse groups or organizations and will be equally relevant to those who plan to work in the not-for-profit, public, and for-profit sectors.\nThis course examines the organizational (macro) and behavioral (micro) dimensions of strategic change in organizations. The focus on managing change that is &quot;strategic&quot; is a key feature of the course and is based on the premise that this is one of the most critical and difficult forms of purposeful organizational adaptation. Strategic change is critical because it is fundamentally connected to a firm's long-term competitiveness and survival. It is difficult because of the complexity of the issues involved and the human and economic barriers that must be overcome. The educational objectives of this course are fourfold: (1) to introduce you to conceptual frameworks for understanding the factors that can inhibit or facilitate timely and effective strategic adaptation; (2) to enhance your ability to analyze real-world change efforts and develop appropriate action plans; (3) to help you build the skills necessary to be an effective change agent or advisor; (4) to deepen your understanding of the connections between a wide range of strategic challenges and the organizational processes critical to addressing them. This course will be particularly useful for students who plan to pursue careers in consulting or general management.\nThe seminar will examine applications of contemporary organization theory to the beer brewing industry.  We will also examine questions about strategy and marketing.  Although the focus will be on beer, other industries will be discussed as well. The primary goal of the seminar is to educate about several general developments in organization theory.  We will examine briefly the origins of the industry and how it compares to others.  We will focus primarily on the contemporary history of the U.S. industry, from the end of Prohibition to the present.  We will analyze the evolution of the industry, exploring the rise of national mass producers such as Anheuser-Busch and Miller and the fall of giants such as Schlitz.  We will also explore the causes and implications of the recent microbrewery revolution, during which the U.S. has surpassed Germany in its number of operating breweries.  We will also examine emerging trends, such as the role of the internet.  We will discuss relevant business and public policy issues.  Among the organizational theories to be discussed: density-dependent legitimation and competition, scale competition, structural inertia, Red Queen competition, social movements and resource partitioning.\nWhy do some ideas succeed and others fail?  What made the Blair Witch Project a huge hit, but Blair Witch II a joke?  Why do people who ride Yamaha motorcycles merely ride motorcycles, while people who ride Harley-Davidsons feel part of a social movement?  We've all heard urban legends about bogus health risks.  Could we harness the power of urban legends to propagate legitimate information about health hazards instead of falsehoods about bogus carcinogens?nnnRecently, Malcom Gladwell has summarized a lot of research in the social sciences about these processes in his book, The Tipping Point.  This course will examine the social science behind Tipping phenomena, focusing on why some ideas &quot;stick&quot; better than others.  We will use research on rumors, urban legends, memes and moral panics to think about why some ideas are more likely to be selected in the marketplace of ideas.  We will also consider whether there are strategies available to help good ideas be selected:  Can trends in arts or fashion be guided?  Do political spin-doctors know something useful about how to make complex ideas widely understandable?  Can misleading, but sticky ideas be effectively combated, e.g., what should you do if you are Intel and a minor flaw has been discovered on the Pentium chip?\nThis seminar focuses on social psychological theories and research relevant to organizational behavior. It reviews the current research topics in micro-organizational behavior, linking these to foundations in cognitive and social psychology and sociology. Topics include models of attribution, social comparison and justice, commitment, stereotyping informal relationships, groups, and leadership. Prerequisites: Enrollment in a PhD program, and a graduate-level social psychology course. Also listed as Sociology 361.\nThis seminar considers the leading sociological approaches to analyzing relations of organizations and environments, with a special emphasis on dynamics. Attention is given to theoretical formulations, research designs, and results of empirical studies. Prerequisite: Enrollment in a PhD program. Also listed as Sociology 262.\nWhat characteristics allow ideas to propagate successfully in social systems? We will use research in psychology and sociology to determine some general characteristics that may lead ideas to be selected (e.g., complexity or emotional valence). At the extreme, these characteristics may lead to distortions in the kind of information available in social systems (psuedo-scientific factoids, rumors, urban legends, moral panics). We will also consider whether these characteristics can be used strategically to propagate ideas (e.g., PR, wartime propaganda) or inhibit them (e.g., debunking rumors, halting moral panics).\nThis course focuses on organizational decision making from the perspective of bounded rationality. We examine a variety of ways in which individual choice behavior is imperfectly rational, and the consequences for institutional behavior and policy outcomes. Implications for both public and private organizations will be considered. Throughout, contrasts will be drawn between models of bounded rationality and of full rationality; consequently some familiarity with theories of rational choice is desirable. (Any course on game theory or decision theory would suffice, as might PS 206W). Although the motivation for this cognitive approach to decision making is primarily empirical, the orientation of this course is primarily theoretical. That is, after a session or two where we review some of the principal empirical findings of (e.g.) Tversky and Kahneman, among others, the focus will then be on theories of organizational choice that build on those empirical findings. Many (not all) of the theories are expressed as mathematical or simulation models. Students will be expected to have either a taste for, or at least a tolerance of, formal reasoning.\nThis course is offered for students requiring specialized training in an area not covered by existing courses. To register, a student must obtain permission from the faculty member who is willing to supervise the reading.\nThis course is elected as soon as a student is ready to begin research for the dissertation, usually shortly after admission to candidacy. To register, a student must obtain permission from the faculty member who is willing to supervise the research.\nAn important component of responsible management is how a company's managers deal with ethical issues.  The three principal objectives of this course are to consider an important set of ethics systems, increase the precision with which students think about, discuss and practice ethics, and provide opportunities to apply ethics systems to business problems. The approach taken to ethics is based on moral principles, and the focus is on systems that provide foundations for ethical intuitions pertaining to well-being, rights and justice.\nTo excel, managers and entrepreneurs must know how to operate successfully in the legal environment of business.  The goal of this course is to teach students how to identify legal issues before they become legal problems.  The goal is not to teach students how to think like lawyers but rather how to deal effectively with the constraints and opportunities created by the law.  This course will address the legal aspects of business agreements and relationships.  Subjects to be covered include contracts, torts, product liability, constitutional law, white collar crime, international business transactions, legal aspects of cyberspace,  intellectual property issues.  We will consider legal aspects of the employment relationship as they relate to protection of trade secrets, wrongful termination, discrimination, and sexual harassment.  We will consider the pros and cons of litigation and alternative dispute resolution (such as arbitration or mediation).  Finally, we will examine the different forms of business organizations available and the fiduciary duties of partners, officers, directors and controlling shareholders.  There will be a two-session workshop led by two investment bankers and two lawyers, during which students will apply the knowledge they have gained throughout the course to analyze issues raised by a hypothetical corporate acquisition and observe a mock term sheet negotiation.\nIn an increasingly global environment and with the rapid evolution of technologies, managers and organizations are confronted with a variety of ethical dilemmas for which solutions are not readily available. The course will explore those situations; it will increase your understanding of their complexity; it will enrich your reasoning about them, while enhancing your confidence in your capacity to handle them in a responsible way. Essentially through the use of recent cases describing complex corporate issues - in global corporations (from US, Europe and the Asia Pacific region) - we will discuss responsibility and action from the individual, the corporate and the societal standpoints. From environmental issues (e.g. global warming), to technology issues (e.g. Yahoo vs. Licra), from individual dilemmas (e.g. the leader's values and shareholder value), to corporate choices (e.g. downsizing, deceptive advertising), from societal (e.g. commoditization of body parts, patenting of genes) to global (e.g. global safety standards, human rights) we will develop methods of reasoning, learning particularly from the philosophers and the economists. Through our learning from corporate and individual ethical misbehavior and responsible behavior we will provide an opportunity to identify how both corporations and individuals can influence performance management in order to go from responsibility to action, for the benefit of future generations. The evaluation will be based on an active involvement in class discussions (40%), one paper on a subject you will choose (40%), and a 2 page book review on a book of your choice (20%).\nNeed approval from sponsoring faculty member and GSB Registrar.\nThis course provides an introduction to political economy with an emphasis on formal models of collective choice, public institutions, and political competition. Topics considered include voting theory, social choice, institutional equilibria, agenda setting, interest group politics, bureaucratic behavior, and electoral competition. Also listed as Political Science 201A.\n(Same as Business P681.) Continuation of 201A, applying the techniques of microeconomic analysis and game theory to the study of political behavior and institutions, including information economics, games of incomplete information, sequential bargaining theory, repeated games, and rational expectations. Applications include agenda formation in legislatures, the implications of legislative structure, government formation, lobbying, electoral competition and interest groups, the control of bureaucracies, interest group competition, and collective choice rules.nnWin (Baron)\nThis course is offered for students requiring specialized training in an area not covered by existing courses. To register, a student must obtain permission from the faculty member who is willing to supervise the reading.\nThis course deals with the overall general management of the business enterprise. Extensive case studies of a variety of companies of differing size, industry, and current conditions provide the basis for the comprehensive analysis and establishment of a strategic management approach for the organization. Frameworks are presented for strategy identification and evaluation; assessing industry attractiveness; evaluating the firm's capabilities, resources, and position; determining the optimal horizontal and vertical scope of the firm; entering into strategic alliances and joint ventures; and formulating and implementing strategy in multi-business organizations.\nThe course is in four parts.  In the first we are concerned with the special nature of the international environment and its impact on firm strategy and operations, paying attention to the cultural, social, political and economic complexities of foreign environments. nnIn the second part we consider alternative mechanisms for entering a foreign market, such as exporting, licensing, direct investment and joint ventures, in the search for a balance between opportunity and risk.  nnGlobally operating firms have opportunities to gain economies of scale and scope, in various parts of the value chain. However, they also need to be responsive to differences in national or regional markets. Understanding the relative importance of these two opposing forces in each of their businesses, and devising structures and processes to accommodate to them effectively, are major challenges and our focus in the third part of the course. nnFor a strategy to be sustainable over time, it must be based on durable competences in the form of organizational architecture, processes and culture, or intellectual capital. This is the focus of the final section of the course. nnThe course uses a variety of industry, company and national settings to simulate the flavor of the international environment.\nThis course deals with the overall general management of the corporation. It is concerned with the determination of the strategic direction of the firm, organizational design issues related to the implementation of a strategy, as well as the management of strategy processes within the firm. The primary objective of the course is for the student to develop a perspective of the general manager's role and responsibilities. The course deals with developing the capability to understand a firm's strategic situation in depth, and to develop viable alternatives for dealing with the key issues facing it. The relationship between organization structure and strategy are examined, and tools are developed for examining the firm's industry and competitive environment, with particular attention paid to how globalization of economies, markets, and industries impact on the competitive dynamics of firms.  Strategy at the business unit, divisional, and corporate level are studied.\nThis course is offered for students who at some time may want to undertake an entrepreneurial career by pursuing opportunities leading to partial or full ownership and control of a business. The course deals with case situations from the point of view of the entrepreneur/manager rather than the passive investor. Most cases involve visitors or videotapes, since the premise is that opportunity and action have large idiosyncratic components. The students must assess opportunity and action in light of the perceived capabilities of the individuals and the nature of the environments they face. The course is integrative and will allow students to apply many facets of their business school education\nThis course is offered for students who at some time may want to undertake an entrepreneurial career by pursuing opportunities leading to partial or full ownership and control of a business.

This relationship is examined from both the entrepreneur's and the venture capitalist's perspective. From the point of view of the entrepreneur, the course considers how significant business opportunities are identified, planned, and built into real companies; how resources are matched with opportunity; and how, within this framework, entrepreneurs seek capital and other assistance from venture capitalists or other sources. From the point of view of the venture capitalist, the course considers how potential entrepreneurial investments are evaluated, valued, structured and enhanced; how different venture capital strategies are deployed; and how venture capitalists raise and manage their own funds. The course includes a term project where students, working in teams, prepare a realistic, action-oriented business plan to either launch a new enterprise or to direct a young business to profitability and/or growth. A special effort is made to take advantage of Stanford's close proximity to the venture capital and entrepreneurial community by making extensive use of guest speakers.\nThis course is offered for students who, in the near term, aspire to the management and full or partial ownership of a new or newly-acquired business. The seminar, which is limited to 40 students, has a strong implementation focus, and deals in some depth with certain selected, generic entrepreneurial issues, viewed from the perspective of the owner/manager. Broad utilization is made of case materials, background readings, visiting experts, and role playing. Throughout the course, emphasis is placed on the application of analytical tools to administrative practice.\nThis course is offered for students who, in the near term, aspire to the management and full or partial ownership of a new or newly-acquired business.

Throughout the course, emphasis is placed on the application of analytical tools to administrative practice.\nThis course is organized around projects undertaken by teams of 4 or 5 students. It will carry 4 units of credit and will be spread over both Winter and Spring quarters in order to give students time to identify a business opportunity and investigate it in depth. The class will meet ten times during the first quarter with introductory lectures and case discussions led by the organizing faculty and involving outside practitioners. The time slot in the Winter Quarter is Tuesday/Friday from 10-11:45. There will be no formal class meetings in the Spring Quarter. The project involves the evaluation of a business opportunity from an initial idea or concept to a final written business plan. The teams will meet with instructors regularly, as well as with a mentor who will help guide the projects. Although not a requirement, teams are encouraged to identify non-sponsoring faculty or professional experts who are willing to provide guidance. nnnDeliverables for the first quarter will include a 5-page summary of progress. During the quarter, teams will meet with faculty and mentors at least twice. Teams will continue on to the second quarter only if their idea is considered viable by both the team members and the faculty. Teams leaving after the winter quarter will be given 2 units of credit and graded on the basis of class participation, team contribution, project progress, and the paper. The second quarter deliverables are a written evaluation of the business opportunity in the form of business plan, an initial presentation to faculty and students, and a final presentation to a panel of faculty, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. During this quarter teams will meet with faculty 2 times and with mentors a minimum of 3 times\nIn this course, our purpose will be to explore issues in managing a growing and/or changing organization.  To this end, three general questions will guide our inquiry:  1)  How do the opportunities for growth and fundamental change vary with a firm's strategy and its ecology?  2)  What challenges generally arise as firms grow and change, and how can these be met?  The answers to these questions depend on the characteristics of your firm and of its competitive environment. In a small firm, one must create an initial growth trajectory, and then adapt the firm and its strategies to the requirements of larger-scale operation.  By contrast, in a larger, more established firm, the key challenge is to sustain growth -- through revitalizing current businesses or possibly by expanding into new areas.  The challenge in both contexts is for managers to design the organization as a system that can grow successfully. Doing so requires sophisticated understanding of processes of organizational change.\nThe idea that firms should take competitive responses into account when designing strategies is obvious, but is often overlooked in practice. This course analyzes the strategies and tactics used by firms in competitive environments, using frameworks developed from recent research in game theory and industrial organization. It is targeted toward students that will be either designing or evaluating strategies in both emerging and mature industries. Topics include: creating barriers to entry, softening price competition, entry and exit strategies, strategic commitment, price discrimination, and bundling.\nThis course seeks to provide an overview of the strategic, governance, and management issues facing nonprofit organizations in the era of venture philanthropy and social entrepreneurship, including the similarities and differences between the nonprofit and business sectors. After examining the economic, historic, and legal characteristics of the nonprofit sector, the students will examine a series of strategic and governance issues representative of those confronting the individual not-for-profit enterprise and its leadership, from the point of view of both the executive director/CEO and its board. Specifically, the student will examine the relationship and implications of mission and strategy and explore the characteristics and implications of board leadership and its effect on governance. The student will also be introduced to core managerial issues uniquely defined by this sector such as nonprofit finance, development/fundraising, investment management, and the management of volunteers and professionals. Cases involve a range of nonprofits including education, social service, environment, health care, and performing arts. In exploring these issues, this course builds upon the frameworks and concepts of strategic management introduced in the core first year courses.\nThe information processing industry is examined through consideration of its major segments, including among others semiconductors, computers, and computer software. In this course, the sources of global competitive success and failure in this industry are examined through studies of approximately ten case histories dealing with firms or groups of firms in this industry.nnFour levels of analysis are employed through these cases: 1) firm level 2) intra-firm level activities 3) industry segment level (e.g., semiconductors) and 4) inter-industry segment level interaction (e.g., semiconductors and computers) encounter as members of an industry segment. Through intra-firm analysis, we examine the processes through which strategies emerge and are implemented. At the industry segment level analysis, we examine the pattern of growth of, for instance, the semiconductor industry and the competition between various technologies. At the inter-industry segment level we study the impact of developments in one industry (semiconductors) on others (personal computers). nnThroughout this course we will be examining the impact of technological change and global competitive forces on industry structure and the competitive position of selected firms.nnThere will be a term project in which groups of four students will be asked to locate a local technology-based firm and perform a strategy audit on this firm or a part of it. Groups are expected to produce progress reports and a final report.\nThis course focuses on the strategic management of technology-based innovation in the firm. The purpose is to provide students with concepts, frameworks, and experiences that are useful for taking part in the management of innovation processes in the firm. The course examines how they can be managed effectively. Specific topics include: assessing the innovative capabilities of the firm, managing the Corporate R &amp; D function, managing the interfaces between functional groups in the development function in the firm, understanding a managing technical entrepreneurs, building technology-based distinctive competencies and competitive advantages, technological leadership versus followership in competitive strategy, institutionalizing innovation, attracting and keeping corporate entrepreneurs.\nFocused on companies operating in a global environment, this course addresses strategies for expanding abroad.  The course examines alternative ways of entering a foreign market, including exporting, licensing, direct investment and joint ventures. Attention is given to understanding the cultural, social, political and economic complexities of foreign environments, and their implications for the firm's financial, organizational, technological and human resource practices.nn nnKey themes are balancing globalization demands with the need for local responsiveness and the development of sustainable strategies based on proprietary competences.nnnOBJECTIVES nnn&sect;\tTo develop your ability to manage the opportunities &amp; risks of international businessnn&sect;\tTo understand the special issues of managing an international organizationnn&sect;\tTo reinforce your capacities of strategic analysis and application in an international contextnn&sect;\tTo help develop your abilities to think outside narrow frameworks and incorporate broad perspectives into decision-making.nnnFORMATnnnInteractive, applied discussion based on cases, readings and experience, using general frameworks.

In this seminar, we review research that attempts to answer this question systematically.  We review data covering organizations in a variety of industries to see how competitiveness varies over time and among organizations.  Taking an evolutionary perspective, we try to make sense of these observed patterns, seeing competitiveness as emerging both from processes of natural selection and organizational learning.  Our thinking will highlight the role played by strategic differences among organizations, and the sometimes-odd ways that strategies shape the competitiveness of organizations.\nThis course is about using entrepreneurial skills to craft innovative responses to social problems. Entrepreneurs are particularly good at recognizing opportunities, exploring innovative approaches, mobilizing resources, managing risks, and building viable enterprises. These skills are just as valuable in the social sector as they are in business. If anything, they are even more urgently needed in the social sector. The solutions to social problems have been surprisingly unaffected by larger economic trends; neither the economic boom of the 90's or the current recession have altered the need for new ways to effect change: A more micro strategy, involving  specific individual entrepreneurial efforts offers some of the most promising ways for creating deep systemic changes.\nThe hype surrounding the rise and fall of &quot;dot-com&quot; businesses gave way to a process where both established firms and start-ups are taking advantage of a variety of electronic commerce capabilities. This course explores ways in which firms can use electronic commerce to create value, and strategies for capturing a portion of that value. The course will examine such issues as: how electronic commerce facilitates the exchange of goods and services that are difficult to exchange using traditional means; how electronic commerce is likely to change traditional supply chains; web-based and multi-channel retailing; how electronic commerce is likely to change logistics and payment systems; the rise and sustainability of web-based intermediaries; the role of web communities in creating sustainable advantage; the impact of electronic commerce on the structure of industries; and the impact of electronic commerce on established companies. We will examine these issues in a variety of industries, for a variety of traditional and internet companies, and in both business-to-business and business-to-consumer contexts.  This course is a 2-unit course meeting in the second half of the quarter.\nStrategic Issues in Philanthropy (SIIP) is a ten-session survey of the philanthropic sector from a strategic management perspective.  Applying strategic decision-making models as frameworks, students will examine the translation of philanthropic vision and capital into social action.  Students will analyze philanthropic strategies as they relate to individual objectives; foundation mission, infrastructure and social investment processes; domestic and international grantmaking; and emerging trends such as venture philanthropy. The course provides an overview of the key operational and strategic distinctions between traditional philanthropic entities, such as community foundations, private foundations, and corporate foundations, as well as contemporary models such as social venture partnerships and other high-engagement grantmakers.  Additional topics include how strategy implementation influences the intersection of philanthropy and the political sector; principles and practices of corporate philanthropy; and the increasing forces for high-impact innovation in the philanthropic marketplace, from social return on investment to performance measurement.Guest speakers will include high profile, global philanthropists and foundation presidents, as well as Silicon Valley business leaders striving to redefine the philanthropic model.  Course work will include readings and case discussions, as well as role-plays and a group project that explore the grant solicitation and assessment process, taking students through a multi-grant evaluation for actual non-profit organizations.  Students will present grant proposals on behalf of local non-profit organizations to a board of nationally regarded foundation presidents, who will subsequently award significant grants to the most effectively advocated nonprofits.  Appropriate for any student driven to effect positive social change from either the for-profit or nonprofit sector, the course will challenge students to expand their own strategic thinking about philanthropic giving and influence.\nThis course is offered for students requiring specialized training in an area not covered by existing courses.

It encompasses knowing how to find assumptions, recognize ambiguity, evaluate arguments, and judge the credibility of sources of expert opinion. To think critically in ones daily life and studies requires being comfortable with questions instead of answers, complexity instead of simplicity, uncertainty instead of certainty. These abilities are developed through practical exercises based on contemporary issues and through practice with texts from a variety of disciplines. Emphasis is on the value of developing a questioning mind and the importance of differentiating between academic and intellectual motivation.nn(Staff) not given 2002-03\nWhen lifelong reading or classroom work is driven by questions, concentration is better, recall is more complete, motivation improves.

How do such notions of literature enter into a particular dynamic when what is ethnicity is asked? How is ethnic writing different from non-ethnic writing, or is there such a thing as either? If ethnicity is accepted as an analytic perspective, how does it affect the way literature is read by ethnic peoples?

More than the Anglo-American analytic tradition which dominates this countrys philosophy departments, European continental 20th-century philosophy has made the effort to think about our present in its existential, social, and political consequences. The continental tradition has thus taken greater risks and probably accepted, in exchange, a lesser degree of rigor in its style of argumentation. Readings/discussion of several analyses of present situations by continental-style philosophers, such as Judith Butler, H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Cixous, Jacques Derrida, J&uuml;rgen Habermas, Martin Heidegger, Reinhart Kosellect, and Alisdair MacIntyre.

Censorship inspired some to conceal political messages in fiction. They wrote about murderers, adulterers, and terrorists whose transgressions challenged social, ethical, and aesthetic boundaries. Readings: three novels that portray the modern city as the locus of crime and self-invention, Dostoevskys <i>Crime and Punishment</i>, Tolstoys <i>Anna Karenina</i>, and Belys <i>Petersburg</i>, and some provincial texts by three masters of short forms: Turgenev, Leskov, and Chekhov.nnWin (Greenleaf)\nIntroduction to the reading of poetry through a variety of poems, emphasizing the ways the meanings of poems are shaped through diction, imagery, figurative language, and technical elements of verse.

GER:3annWin (Gumbrecht)\nHow ethnic literary texts have provided the occasion for the production of particular kinds of selves, and how these productions might disclose the varied possibilities of racialized self-fashioning. The material is comparative in terms of the inter-racial cultural and social histories witnessed in the narrative texts and our own sense of location and identity. Who are these texts written to and how does the issue of audience shift our understanding of the possible significances of the text? How does historical moment contribute to the shape of these narratives and our understandings of race, gender, and ethnicity? What are the relations between aesthetics and ideology? What might the gaps be between the desired effect of the text and its actual realization in the minds of disparate audiences?
