201624,"This course emphasizes the use of accounting information for internal planning and control purposes.  This orientation contrasts with financial accounting where the focus is on accounting disclosures for parties external to the firm.nnnThe course is intended for individuals who will make business decisions and evaluate the performance of business units using data obtained from the accounting system.nnnThe first part of the course covers the vocabulary and mechanics of cost accounting, issues involved in the design of a cost accounting system, and the role of management accounting in decisions concerning resource allocation.  Included in this are discussions of capacity costs, inter-departmental allocations, and activity-based management in both manufacturing and service environments.  We will pay particular attention to various (unintended) dysfunctional consequences of traditional accounting systems, as well as possible solutions to these problems.  nnnThe second part of the course examines the process of evaluating the performance of individuals, business units and firms.  Included in this are issues related to transfer prices and measures of productivity.  We will study the optimal choice of performance metrics for incentive purposes, and analyze the rationale behind the balanced scorecard.  Finally, we will examine methods of estimating cost functions using accounting data, leading to the study of benchmarking procedures, i.e., the process of identifying the most and least productive firms in industries.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

101322,"The instructor and, on a rotating basis, other members of the GSB economics faculty will discuss methods for doing research in economics. Discussion will focus on selecting topics for research, building on existing literature while making original contributions, choosing the appropriate modeling technique, identifying the best empirical strategies, combining theory and evidence, learning when a paper is finished, and providing general tips on how to do successful research. The course will help the student choose a thesis topic and write a successful dissertation. It will also provide a foundation for research that the junior faculty member will be conducting during the first few years following graduate school. nnnThe course, which will meet for 90 minutes once per week, will run throughout the year with a continuing grade. During the Autumn and Winter Quarters, the faculty will present papers and material for discussion. During the Spring term, most of the time will be spent on student discussions and critiques of important papers in the economics literature and on structuring student research papers.

101328,"This course is an introduction to multiperiod models in finance, mainly pertaining to optimal portfolio choice and asset pricing. The course begins with discrete-time models for portfolio choice and security prices, and then moves to a continuous-time setting. The topics then covered include the Black-Scholes model of asset pricing and some of its extensions, models of the term structure of interest rates, valuation of corporate securities, portfolio choice in continuous-time settings, and finally, general-equilibrium asset pricing models.

Strong backgrounds in calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory are recommended. Problem assignments are frequent and, for most students, demanding.

201350,"The underlying assumption of this course is that creativity is essential to happiness, health and success in business and life. Creativity is within everyone, and this seminar goes deep into the thought processes which relate to everyday creativity. The model of a &quot;Hero's Journey&quot; is used as a metaphor for the creative process. Students are given many opportunities to experience and develop their own style of creativity and are required to use heuristics which can help make creativity a solid part of their everyday decision making repertoire. The goal is to make one's life a &quot;work of art.&quot; Course format employs lecture, practical application and class discussion. A special feature of the course this quarter will be the use of the CIB interactive software developed by Professor Ray and others. Students will be required to use this software in place of class sessions in certain parts of the course. Prerequisites are an open mind plus willingness to be introspective, enjoy taking personal risks, and put in substantial work. Students are required to attend regularly and use the CIB software, keep a personal journal, review a relevant book, submit brief weekly papers reflecting on their experience with the course materials, and complete a two-part final project consisting of a written analysis and a creative representation of their own creativity in business.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

101028,"Building on the foundation established in T262 (Operations), T363 will focus on the business processes through which &quot;real work&quot; is accomplished, such as order fulfillment, product development, and customer service. We will discuss fundamental ideas embodied in the total quality management, time-based competition, and business process reengineering movements. Specific topics include: capacity management, integrated work, the impact of variability on process performance, statistical process control, dynamic flow management, time compression, performance measurement systems, and inter-firm coordination. Cases and examples are drawn from a variety of industries, including services, manufacturing, and health care. About one-third of the material is related to tools of process analysis, including several computer assignments. Linear programming and queuing analysis (covered in T245 and T262, respectively) will reappear in T363, but our emphasis is on the business context rather than modeling per se, and the mathematical demands made on students will be modest. About one-half of the class time will be devoted to case discussions. There will be five graded assignments during the quarter, (four group assignments and one individual), plus a few other exercise summaries to be handed in. The assignments will include case analyses, computer simulations, and hands-on simulation exercises. At the instructor's discretion, a group project (for three or four students) with an actual operating unit may be undertaken as a separate, two-unit course on a mandatory pass/fail basis.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

101083,"Conflict is inherent in organizations. Conflict arises whenever independent parties-individuals, departments, organizations-must secure an agreement. Parties involved face a decision between competitive and cooperative solutions: Will competition bring a favorable result or will it escalate to dysfunctional levels? Will cooperation foster a valuable working relationship or will it leave an underlying problem unresolved? This course presents a variety of frameworks for analyzing conflicts and techniques for resolving conflicts. Many dimensions of conflict are discussed, including relevant psychological, interpersonal, organizational, and cultural dynamics. This course reviews strategy and tactics in various conflict resolution procedures, including bargaining, distributive and integrative negotiation, mediation, and arbitration. A conceptual understanding is of little use, however, without an understanding of how to put strategy and tactics into practice. To this end, considerable emphasis will be placed on exercises and role-play simulations of conflicts designed to develop students' negotiation skills.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

In addition, networks are critical determinants of identity -- shaping preferences and influencing perceptions of the qualities that inhere in actors. Drawing from a broad array of intellectual traditions, such as social exchange theory, role theory, as well as economic and historical sociology, this course considers research that informs the link between networks and identity.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

201354,"This course has three main objectives. The first is to analyze the nature of the EU political system and how it works. The focus will be on the interaction between the Union, member states, organized interests and  public opinion. The second is to examine the major policies of the EU , both those that affect business directly such as competition or cohesion policies and those who shape the European and national business environments (market de-regulation). Whenever  appropriate comparisons will be made  between  different approaches to policies in the EU and the US, such as in the realm of  anti-trust law (the GE-Honeywell case) or  agricultural trade ( the issue of  GMO).The third objective is to study the consequences of the monetary union and of  the planned expansion eastwards. Both developments  are bound to change significantly in the medium term the nature of the Union and its policies.

201172,"Many of America's most successful entrepreneurial companies have been substantially influenced by professionally managed venture capital. This relationship is examined from both the entrepreneur's and the venture capitalist's perspective. From the point of view of the entrepreneur, the course considers how significant business opportunities are identified, planned, and built into real companies; how resources are matched with opportunity; and how, within this framework, entrepreneurs seek capital and other assistance from venture capitalists or other sources. From the point of view of the venture capitalist, the course considers how potential entrepreneurial investments are evaluated, valued, structured and enhanced; how different venture capital strategies are deployed; and how venture capitalists raise and manage their own funds. nnThe course includes a term project where students, working in teams, prepare a realistic, action-oriented business plan to either launch a new enterprise or to direct a young business to profitability and/or growth. A special effort is made to take advantage of Stanford's close proximity to the venture capital and entrepreneurial community by making extensive use of guest speakers.

201358,"In this course, our purpose will be to explore issues in managing a growing and/or changing organization. To this end, three general questions will guide our inquiry: 1) How do the opportunities for growth and fundamental change vary with a firm's strategy and its ecology? 2) What challenges generally arise as firms grow and change, and how can these be met? The answers to these questions depend on the characteristics of your firm and of its competitive environment. In a small firm, one must create an initial growth trajectory, and then adapt the firm and its strategies to the requirements of larger-scale operation. By contrast, in a larger, more established firm, the key challenge is to sustain growth -- through revitalizing current businesses or possibly by expanding into new areas. The challenge in both contexts is for managers to design the organization as a system that can grow successfully. Doing so requires sophisticated understanding of processes of organizational change.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
101088,"The crisis in Asia - after many years of rapid growth - raises a number of questions about the relative merits of alternative paths of development, and about our capacity to anticipate the future. If the current crisis has created very dramatic socio-economic situations in several Asian countries, it has also provided - beyond the change process - many opportunities for foreign investors, for transfer of technology, and for different types of partnerships. In this context the &quot;challenge&quot; to operate within the mosaic of Asian cultures - experiencing great turbulence - is more actual than ever. The course will analyze the complex interdependence between &quot;culture&quot;, management philosophies, corporate strategies and the current dynamics of socio-economic development. Alternative models will be used to understand this interdependence, while the course will emphasize the skills necessary to handle effectively (specific) problems associated with work in different Asian cultures. Starting from today's situation in the region, the first part of the course will analyze the relationship between values and economic and managerial behavior (e.g. Confucian ethics and socio-economic development, Islam and corporate behavior in Malaysia, ideology and practices in Overseas Chinese organizations). The course will then discuss the relationship between culture and human resource management (e.g. recruiting staff and training for technology transfer in Thailand, expatriate profile for Japan, Korea and China, motivating and managing career development in Hong Kong and Singapore, role of &quot;Third Country Nationals&quot; in the ASEAN region). The course will then deal with &quot;sensitive issues such as nepotism, bribery and corruption, race and religion as they affect managerial attitudes and corporate behavior (with examples from Vietnam, the Philippines and China). Cases of US, European and Asian corporations operating in the region will help participants to have concrete and current examples of the difficulties and the conditions of success in operating through the different cultures of the Asia Pacific region.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
201002,"In this seminar, we will look at competition in a number of different markets: we will look at emerging art markets, contested occupational markets, venture capital and investment banking markets, as well as the market for corporate control.  In examining each of these markets we will be concerned with the same basic issue: the role of status and identity in shaping market outcomes.nnnIndeed, the central premise of this seminar is that the status and/or identity of an actor is a fundamental determinant of the opportunities and constraints that a market actor faces.  However, conventional models of markets tend to downplay the role of status and identity and, in the process, miss some important dynamics underlying competition.  Drawing on sociological work over the last twenty years (including some of the instructor's own research), this seminar aims to provide some insight into this overlooked aspect of market competition.  nnnAmong the questions that we will consider are: What tactics do market actors use to preserve or enhance their market status?  What role do third parties in markets - like analysts, journalists, or critics - play in the establishment of identities?  How does a market actor's status and identity impact on its ability to learn and innovate and, accordingly, on the strategies that the actor can or should pursue?",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

110991,"Against the background of films novelty in the early 20th century and the ponderous movements towards an art derivative of literature and theater, the avant-garde has located cinematic art in spatio-temporal experiment. Beginning with Futurism, the avant-gardes of Europe, the U.S.S.R., and the U.S. celebrated and produced films that opposed narrative cinematic conventions. Through a reflexive engagement with the mediums metamorphic fluidity, film could produce abstraction, political argument, an entry into the rhetoric of the unconscious and the realm of cognition, refusals of meaning, and explorations of perception.

Along with assemblage (its three dimensional equivalent) and montage (its counterpart in photography, film, and video), collage has introduced many of the crucial aesthetic issues of the modern and postmodern eras.

100853,"The purpose of this course is to use microeconomics to evaluate public policy.  The course has two parts.  The goal of the first part of the course is to provide a comprehensive microeconomic toolkit.  We will use this toolkit (1) to identify what the role of the government in the economy should be, if the only motivation for public intervention in private markets were to improve economic efficiency - that is, to increase the overall size of the economic pie without regard to its distribution and (2) to measure the economic benefits and costs of public policies, and how these benefits and costs are distributed among different actors.  The second part of the course applies this toolkit to current policy issues.  On the first day of class, the students choose from a menu which policy issues we will cover.  The goal of this part of the class is to assess the efficiency and distributional consequences of these policies and to discuss the potential for better alternatives.nnSpr (Kessler)",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

201650,"Preference to freshmen. Over the last 30 years, mathematicians, physicists, and other scientists have claimed evidence of patterns such as fractals and multifractals throughout nature, and even in non-natural phenomena such as finance. Such patterns involving infinitely repeated geometric structures are beautiful to look at and fun to learn about, but the claims of the proponents of these ideas have invited backlash. The evidence for fractal-like behavior in different fields and why these ideas can be so attractive to proponents and yet invite reactions.nn(Staff) not given 2002-03",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

To this end, it is important that we understand the resources and systems that sustain our lives.  This course examines the energy, water, food, labor and other inputs that make our lives at Stanford possible.  We explore these issues through site visits (the energy plant, a landfill,  an organic farm, the water treatment  plant, a green building model, etc.) and by talking with key thinkers and actors in these areas.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
126687,"This course will focus on analysis of the structure of a variety of complex contracts and transactions with both a positive and normative goal. We hope to learn more about the patterns of contractual governance that have emerged with respect to different types of transactions: How do parties order their commercial interactions? Perhaps more important, we hope to build on that learning to teach how parties may more effectively govern their business relations: How should parties order their commercial interactions? The course will be divided into two parts. The first, involving roughly half the semester, is designed to introduce the students to the economic and negotiating tools and necessary to evaluate alternative transactional structures, including transaction costs, information economics, risk sharing and incentives, property rights, finance, and negotiation theory. The second half of the course will apply the tools developed in the first half to real transactions. The class will be divided into five teams, each of which will be assigned a different complex real world transaction, and will be given a full set of the transaction documents. Each transaction will be allocated two classes. For the first class, a student team will prepare readings that include the actual transaction documents, an overview of the legal and regulatory character of the industry, and a description of the competitive characteristics of the industry. The student team will present their transaction during the first class. In the second class, a presentation will be made by the lawyers and/or clients who actually participated in the transaction. The point is to give students the opportunity to test how the class approach corresponds to the way those who &quot;did the deal&quot; understood it. In prior offerings, the &quot;deals&quot; covered included a movie financing, the securitization of U.S. long distance telephone receivables by a Mexican telephone company, the acquisition of Northwest Airways, a venture capital financing transaction, a biotech joint venture, the project financing of large power facilities, both in the U.S. and abroad, and GE's acquisition of the European and Asian heavy gas turbine business of the licensee of GE technology. The idea is to present as broad a range of transactions as possible.nnSpecial Instructions: There is a paper required that is a team project, due on the last day of the exam period.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The examination will be conductednn  using the famous materials prepared by Professors Henry Hart and Albert Sacks of the Harvard Law School (The Legal Process - Basic Problems in thenn  Making and Application of Law) that were taught to a generation of law students (including the instructor). Classes will focus on specific problems in thenn  materials that are designed to illustrate how law is made by various institutions, ranging from private parties, to common law courts, to administrativenn  agencies, to legislatures, to courts carrying out their roles in reviewing decisions made by other participants in the process. One of the principal questions onnn  which the course will focus is the advantages and disadvantages of decisionmaking by different institutions and how they should affect the making of publicnn  policy through legislation, executive branch actions, and court decisions.

Students are asked to address some of the worlds most serious health care crises.  The series is composed of three distinct courses: Comparative Global Health (261A), Global Medical Systems (261B), and Health Professionals Responding as Global Citizens (261C). Upon successful completion of the series, an optional summer field experience is available. Series topics include: areas of the world experiencing the heaviest illness burdens, international health infrastructure of organizations that respond to these crises, human rights laws, medical neutrality and international law for health professionals intervening in disaster relief and/or war zones, legal rights and responsibilities for those working in vulnerable settings, and structure of global health care delivery with emphasis on access to medical services for vulnerable populations. The third quarter of the series prepares the student for the actual field experience; students learn how culture impacts health care delivery and influences clinical care.

127286,"The availability of three-dimensional atomic structures of proteins and nucleic acids allows interpretation of biological processes based on the physical and chemical properties of these molecules. Crystallographic studies include structural themes exemplified by local chain conformation, secondary structure, domains, families of folds, protein folding, and thermodynamic stability. How these structures move is considered by combining the results of experiments with theoretical molecular dynamics simulations: enzyme catalysis. Novel molecules are engineered from the experimental and predictive aspects, using interactive computer graphics programs to illustrate problems. Systems include protein-nucleic acid complexes and antibody-antigen interactions.
